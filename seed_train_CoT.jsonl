Understand the question: The question asks about possible changes in relationship status for a biological male when his age changes to 35. It focuses on how marital or relationship status could differ specifically for males at a certain age.\n    2. Identify relevant columns (Schema Linking): The relevant columns are \"gender\" (to specify biological male), \"age\" (to specify the age shift to 35), and \"marital-status\" (to observe potential changes in relationship status).\n    3. Confirm time series involvement: Time series analysis is not involved because the question is about a status change at a single age point, not over a sequence of time or continuous time data.\n    4. Determine target column: The target column is \"marital-status\" because the question concerns changes in relationship status.\n    5. Map inference conditions: The inference condition is gender = Male, since the question restricts the analysis to biological males.\n    6. Map update conditions (if any): The update condition is age = 35, representing the age shift being examined for potential changes in marital status.\n    7. Determine task type: The task type is classification because \"marital-status\" is a categorical variable with discrete possible values, and the goal is to predict the category of relationship status.\n", "output": "{\n  \"time_series\": \"False\",\n  \"target_column\": \"<col>marital-status</col>\",\n  \"inference_condition\": [\n    \"<col>gender</col><op>=</op><val>Male</val>\"\n  ],\n  \"update_condition\": [\n    \"<col>age</col><op>=</op><val>35</val>\"\n  ],\n  \"task\": \"classification\"\n}"}
