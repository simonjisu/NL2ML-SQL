Understand the question: The question asks to identify anomalies in destination census tracts over time, implying a need to analyze unusual patterns or deviations in where trips end and to observe these changes temporally.\n    2. Identify relevant columns (Schema Linking): The pertinent column is \"dropoff_census_tract\" as it represents the destination census tract. Additionally, temporal columns like \"trip_start_timestamp\" or \"trip_end_timestamp\" relate to the \"over time\" aspect.\n    3. Confirm time series involvement: Yes, time series analysis is involved since the question explicitly mentions \"over time,\" indicating anomaly detection should consider changes or patterns across time intervals.\n    4. Determine target column: The target column is \"dropoff_census_tract\" because the anomalies to be identified pertain specifically to destination census tracts.\n    5. Map inference conditions: There are no specific conditions given to filter or constrain the data; thus, the inference condition list is empty.\n    6. Map update conditions (if any): The question does not imply any update conditions or changes to parameters within the analysis, so none are applicable.\n    7. Determine task type: The task is \"anomaly_detection\" as the goal is to identify unusual or unexpected patterns in destination census tracts over time.\n</start_thinking>", "output": {"time_series": "True", "target_column": "<col>dropoff_census_tract</col>", "inference_condition": [], "task": "anomaly_detection"}}
